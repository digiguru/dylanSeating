DylanSeating.js
===============

This is an experiment with [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/), [Soket.IO](http://socket.io/) and [RaphaelJS](http://raphaeljs.com/).

The premise is to make a really basic navigation. No right clicks, no peculiar quasimods. Just a straight forward rich exciting UI.

After being inspired by new fangled awsome sites like [Trello](http://trello.com) I thought collaberation would be a perfect match to a table planner, brides and grooms can design their seating plan for their big day with the minimum of fuss.

Example Site
============

I have created a free Heroku to test the product. 

http://digiguru.herokuapp.com/

Next Up Tasks
=============

 * Make the actions that go to and from the server a collection

Future Ideas
============

 * Redis storage rather than mongo (don't really use the full power of mongo, redis would be faster)
 * Add abililty to save & load different plans
 * OAuth integration
 * mobile / tablet investigation
